# Node Interface Extractor

## Description

Node Interface Extractor is a Node.js script designed to automate the extraction of TypeScript interfaces from `.ts` and `.tsx` files in a project. It scans specified directories, extracts each interface, and writes them into individual files in a designated types directory.
